The Python script might take too much memory for Pico, will need to improve it.

Increase the training dataset to 60000 samples (was 10000), but the accuracy is still ~60% (max 65% I tried). We are reaching the algorithm limit. So my algorithm is not good enough, and maybe can try adding neural layer number later.

By reducing the learning factor k, the AI recognition accuracy is increased to over 90%
